Just as I started my Sinatra project, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer for the third time. She died a couple weeks before the time of this writing. I have a medical background so I took an active role flying home on several occasions to help my parents navigate the medical system, care for my mom and hitch a ride on the cancer roller coaster.  As a result my project got derailed a bit.  

I learned a lot about keeping a creative endeavor going while exhausted and numb.  My section leader Jennifer and educational coach Katie were awesome through the whole thing.  Thank you.

This will be short and hopefully sweet.  I'm ready to put this project to bed. I'm nothing special.  This trial was not unique to me.  I just wanted to throw some thoughts out there for someone else who might find themselves in the big weird.

## Creativity is Hard
As I stated before, I have a medical background.  I was an EMT and EMT Instructor, so I'm no stranger to stressful conditions, exhaustion and ambiguity.  There is just something different about trying to come up with something new while dealing with life stresses.  Two insidious things plagued me during this endevor.  Ultimately, I learned to recognize these barriers so I could climb my way out, and knock this project out.

The first was the numbness.  There were periods of sadness sure,  but it was the numbness that got me.  I'd spend several days caring for my mom, facing bad stuff, until she'd get into the clear.  I'd return home thinking she was on the mend.  At home I'd feel fine, I wanted to dive right back into life and code.  Because of my background I thought I was fine and should be able to function.  I'd stare at my screen for hours.  I was fried.  

Becuase I wasn't breaking down in tears I thought I was fine.  The mind reacts to chronic stress by going numb.  You have to do human things like talk, laugh, love, breath good air into your lungs to combat the numb.  You have to consciously make your self do those little things to bring the human back.  Because creativity is human.

The second insidious thing was the weight I put on myself.  As I faced my mom's mortality, I thought about my own.  That sense of mortality crept in as I stared numb at the screen.  I wanted to build something cool with meaning.  The initial idea behind Burnbucket, a way to track how you spend moments, was simple.  You only have so much time left, how are you going to spend it?  With that meaning, I was driven to perfection.  I wanted simple, I wanted a philosophy in the code.  With this drive to apply meaning, came doubts, second guessing, deferring code to get the concept just right. 

And so I spun.

## Break the Spin
I found myself saying over and over.  If only I was in a lab section.  I'd be able to zone out and solve problems.  I needed small wins.  My educational coach Katie had an awesome recommendation, Code Wars.  They have katas that are just like labs.  I did a few of those to get the juices flowing.  To break the spin to find a rhythm again.

## Big Swaths of Time
Speaking of rhythm.  While caring for my mom I tried to spend down time working on my project.  She needed help frequently.  I have a two year old at home so I'm used to frequent interuptions.  Solving a discrete known problem intermittently is possible.  Save your progress commit working code, come back.  No problem. Hah.  Creativity takes nice chunks of time without distraction to get a rhythm going.  Only when I recognized this and found consistent chunks of time did I make good progress.

## Combat Rhythm Killers
I started keeping a dev log.  When I'd sit down to code for the day I'd write some tasks I wanted to tackle.  As new tasks popped in my head I'd throw them in a back log.  Having finite steps to tackle helped keep me from wandering and spinning.  I'd mark the task I was currently working on in case I got interupted. 

WIth interuptions and spinning in search of perfection, I found I lost track of what I was actually trying to build.  I'd written my goal down but I drifted, thinking about "clever" abstract ways to build the app.  I found my self comfortably spinning on the abstraction instead of just trying to solve the problem.  A laser focused reminder everyday of what I was trying to solve helped me get out of abstraction land.

## Layout is not an Afterthought
I naturally think in terms of data models.  I enjoy imagining the structure of data and how it flows and relates.  On this project I focused and spun on the data model so much I neglected how the interface would work.  I wanted something clean and simple that worked naturally with just routes, html and css.  I did do some low fidelity wire frames in my planning phase, but they were too abstract.  I might experiment with mocking up layouts in html and css with dummy data next time before even diving into the backend.  I think this will also relieve some of the stress of time consuming css finessing in the eleventh hour.

## Finally
Sometimes you need to code like you'll return.  In the Pacific Northwest, our resident cult travel writer/PBS TV host, Rick Steves likes to say, "Travel like you'll return."  In other words don't try to go on a grand tour of Europe with one week's vacation.  Don't put that pressure on yourself.  Sometimes it's better to just go to a little town in Cornwall and be a resident for a few days.  

Like travelling, don't try to code the equivelent of the grand tour.  If it's worthwhile, you'll be back.  Leave yourself some clues to find your way back easily.  

I do see irony in saying you'll be back in a blog post inspired by death.  Make the most of what you build.  Just don't try to build it all.  What you do build will be all the better for it.  If you made it to this point, thanks for listening. Cheers.
